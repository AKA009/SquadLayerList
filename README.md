# Squad Layer Lists
This repo contains multiple layer lists compatible with SquadJS.
Via the `exporter.py` script, everyone can generate a layer list from the Squad SDK by just running the Python Script from the menu `File > Execute Python Script...`, the output will be in the `Saved` directory of the Squad SDK
# Credits
